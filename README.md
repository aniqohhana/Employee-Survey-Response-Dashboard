# Employee Survey Responses Dashboard
The [dataset](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&page=6&pageSize=5) is actual responses from an employee engagement survey conducted by Pierce County WA and completed voluntarily by government employees. 
This dataset consists 10 fields as response id, status, department, director, manager, supervisor, staff, question, response, and response text.

The dataset contains 15 duplicate data and 270 missing data.

In this project, data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) were performed using Excel and Python.
In Excel, duplicate data was removed using the Remove Duplicates feature in the Data menu and missing data was filled using the Find and Replace feature. Visualizations were created using Pivot Charts.
In Python, duplicate and missing data were handled using the Pandas library and visualizations were created using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

Dashboards were created using Power BI and [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/EmployeeSurveyDashboard_17387427918470/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
